# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning in order to predict credit risk. By training and evaluating the model using different methods such as RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids and SMOTEENN. Using the data provided each of the different methods of analysis will be tested to see which is most accurate at predicting credit risk.

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
